Please go to the `Preview` tab and select the appropriate template according to your branch type.

*Note: This only works when creating the pull request for the first time.*

* [Feature template](?expand=1&template=feature_template.md) -- for feature branches
* [Release template](?expand=1&template=release_template.md) -- for release branches

If template selection does not work, simply copy the appropriate template and paste it into your description.
